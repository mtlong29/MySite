A decent amount of my free time is spent designing various things using photoshop. I like how this mini project turned out so I decided to include it in my portfolio.

## Material Used

I used the following three images as well as various techniques in photoshop to design a simple collage of Michael Jordan dunking.

<figure class="half">
  <a href="/assets/images/post-dunk/jordan.jpg" title="Original image of Jordan."><img src="/assets/images/post-dunk/jordan.jpg" alt="Original image of Jordan."></a>
  <a href="/assets/images/post-dunk/goal.jpg" title="Original image of goal."><img src="/assets/images/post-dunk/goal.jpg" alt="Original image of goal."></a>
</figure>

<figure class="half">
  <a href="/assets/images/post-dunk/background.jpg" title="Original background image."><img src="/assets/images/post-dunk/background.jpg" alt="Original background image."></a>
</figure>
