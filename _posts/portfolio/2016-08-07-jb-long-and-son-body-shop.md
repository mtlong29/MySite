I was tasked with creating a website for JB Long and Son Body Shop. This is a Body Shop found in Frankfort, Kentucky. This post documents the journey taken while designing and developing this website. The published website can be found at <a href="http://www.jblongandsonbodyshop.com">jblongandsonbodyshop.com</a>.

## Design
I wanted the design of this site to be simple such that the objective of JB Long and Son Body Shop is nearly instantaneously known.

### Evolution One (August 22, 2016)
Below is the first version of the site. This version was delivered to the client in request of content. I added as much content as I knew and/or found online, but I needed more from the client before the site could be completed.

<div class="scroll-box">

</div>

### Evolution Two (August 13, 2017)
Below is the first finished version of the site. Obviously lots of time has passed between the first version and this version. The main difference is the addition of actual content. I also used <a href="https://github.com/koenoe/cocoen">cocoen.js</a>. It is an image comparison slider. This is much better than simply adding the before and after pictures next to each other like before.

</div>

## Development
The source code of www.jblongandsonbodyshop.com can be found <a href="https://github.com/mtlong29/JBShop_Site">here</a>. This is a jekyll based site. The use of jekyll can be found in <a href="/blog/using-jekyll/">this</a> post. 

## What I learned
<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web. Basically makes front-end web development faster and easier. In other words bootstrap is meant for web developers of all skill levels. I decided it would be a good idea to learn this framework as designing this site.
