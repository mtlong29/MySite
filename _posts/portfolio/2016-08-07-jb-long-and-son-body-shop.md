I was tasked with creating a website for JB Long and Son Body Shop. This is a Body Shop found in Frankfort, Kentucky. This post documents the journey taken while designing and developing this website. The published website can be found at <a href="http://www.jblongandsonbodyshop.com">jblongandsonbodyshop.com</a>.

## Design
I wanted the design of this site to be simple such that the objective of JB Long and Son Body Shop is nearly instantaneously known.

#### Site as of August 13, 2017
Below is the "finished" version of the JB Long and Son Body Shop site. I put quotations around finished, because as a designer I always want to improve things. I always want to add new features, and constaly making something I'm proud of.

As of August 13, 2017 the JB Long and Son Body Shop site is a one page site with few features. The main objective of this site is to provide someone with information about JB Long and Son Body Shop quickly and effortlessly. The user can swipe over old repairs using the comparison slider. The User can quickly see what services the shop offers as well. Next, the user can learn more about some of the JB Long and Son Body Shop employees in the "Meet Us!" section.

Most importantly, the user can find quick and easy to read contact information where they would expect it, at the bottom of the page.
