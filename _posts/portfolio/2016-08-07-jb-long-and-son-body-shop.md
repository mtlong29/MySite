I was tasked with creating a website for JB Long and Son Body Shop. This is a Body Shop found in Frankfort, Kentucky. This post documents the journey taken while designing and developing this website. The published website can be found at <a class="fancyLink" href="http://www.jblongandsonbodyshop.com" target="_blank">jblongandsonbodyshop.com</a>.

## Design
I wanted the design of this site to be simple in such a way that the objective of JB Long and Son Body Shop is nearly instantaneously known.

### Evolution One (August 22, 2016)

### Evolution Two
Soon to come! I will post new site evolutions here when reasonable.

## Development
The source code of www.jblongandsonbodyshop.com can be found <a class="fancyLink" href="https://github.com/mtlong29/JBShop_Site" target="_blank">here</a>. I considered putting code snippets in this post, but decided against it because I would rather a portfolio item cover design. 

This is a jekyll based site. The use of jekyll can be found in <a class="fancyLink" href="{{site.url}}/blog/using-jekyll/">this</a> post. 

## What I learned
This site uses bootstrap as well as jekyll. I decided to stick with jekyll because I enjoyed its flexibility as well as its simplicity.

<a class="fancyLink" href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web. Basically makes front-end web development faster and easier. In other words bootstrap is meant for web developers of all skill levels. I decided it would be a good idea to learn this framework as designing this site.
