## GMM #TakeAndMake

[Good Mythical Morning](https://www.youtube.com/user/rhettandlink2) is a YouTube channel that has a daily morning talk show. At the end of every episode they spin a wheel and sometimes the wheel lands on something called take and make. Take and make is when you take a still from that episode and make it into something else. This time you were to make them into aliens. Below is one that I made. It is made out of *15 individual images*.
