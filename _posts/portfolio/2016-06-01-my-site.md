Creating this website started out as a minor project to occupy my time. However, I soon feel in love with web development leading me to the pursuit of additional projects. The best way I know how to obtain new projects is to demonstrate my skills. What better site to demonstrate my web development skills than this very site. I will add to this post as development of this site continues.

## Design
I wanted the design of this site to be relatively involved because it has basically involved to a giant resume and/or portfolio.

### Evolution One (August 23, 2016)
This is obviously not the true first evolution of this site because it is much older than this. However, this is the first evolution I am actually happy to show off. Below are images of the three "main" pages: home, portfolio, and blog.

#### Home Page
<div class="scroll-box">
    <img src="/images/post-mtlong-site-evo/evo1/home.jpg">
</div>

#### Portfolio Page
<div class="scroll-box">
    <img src="/images/post-mtlong-site-evo/evo1/portfolio.jpg">
</div>

#### Blog Page
<div class="scroll-box">
    <img src="/images/post-mtlong-site-evo/evo1/blog.jpg">
</div>

### Evolution Two
I will post images of evolutions two and beyond as the site changes.

## Development
The source code of www.matthewlong.io can be found <a class="fancyLink" href="https://github.com/mtlong29/MySite" target="_blank">here</a>. I considered putting code snippets in this post, but decided against it because I would rather a portfolio item cover design. 

This is a jekyll based site. The use of jekyll can be found in <a class="fancyLink" href="{{site.url}}/blog/using-jekyll/">this</a> post. 

## What I Learned
Creating this site has really opened my eyes and showed me how much I actually love web design and development. As mentioned above this has led to my pursuit of new web development projects.

When creating this site I was introduced to <a class="fancyLink" href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">jekyll</a>. Jekyll is a static site generator. 

I also gained more experience using css, and html.
