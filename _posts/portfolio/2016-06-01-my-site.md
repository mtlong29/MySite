Creating this website started out as a minor project to occupy my time. However, I soon feel in love with web development leading me to the pursuit of additional projects. The best way I know how to obtain new projects is to demonstrate my skills. What better site to demonstrate my web development skills than this very site. I will add to this post as development of this site continues.

## Design

I wanted the design of this site to be relatively involved because it has basically involved to a giant resume and/or portfolio.

#### Landing Page

The mtlong.me landing page can be seen below.

<div class="macbook-pro-mockup">

## Development

The source code of www.matthewlong.io can be found <a href="https://github.com/mtlong29/MySite">here</a>. I considered putting code snippets in this post, but decided against it because I would rather a portfolio item cover design. 

This is a jekyll based site. The use of jekyll can be found in <a href="/blog/using-jekyll/">this</a> post.
