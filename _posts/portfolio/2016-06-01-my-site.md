Little inception for this portfolio post. It's this very site! 

## Design

I wanted the design of this site to be relatively simple because it has basically evolved into a giant resume and/or portfolio. That makes for a very simple site. The site also contains a blog typically about web and software development.

#### Landing Page

The mtlong.me landing page contains three portfolio entries that I can select using a `featured: true` declaration in an individual posts YAML. It also contains the latest 4 blog entries.

<div class="macbook-pro-mockup">
  <img src="/assets/images/mockups/macbook-pro-mockup.png" alt="MacBook Pro Container">
  <div class="macbook-pro-mockup-content">
    <img src="/assets/images/post-mtlong-site-evo/mysite-home.jpg" alt="Snapshot of the mtlong.me landing page.">
  </div>
</div>

#### Portfolio Page

The mtlong.me portfolio page contains all portfolio entries. I add and delete (typically delete them by hiding) them depending on many things. The objective is to always make this page the best version it can be.

<div class="macbook-pro-mockup">
  <img src="/assets/images/mockups/macbook-pro-mockup.png" alt="MacBook Pro Container">
  <div class="macbook-pro-mockup-content">
    <img src="/assets/images/post-mtlong-site-evo/mysite-portfolio.jpg" alt="Snapshot of the mtlong.me portfolio page.">
  </div>
</div>

#### Blog Page

The mtlong.me blog page contains most blog entries. Once enough blogs are written I will make it so that you can paginate through them. However, at the time of writing this portfolio entry there are not enough published blog posts to have a pagination function.

<div class="macbook-pro-mockup">
  <img src="/assets/images/mockups/macbook-pro-mockup.png" alt="MacBook Pro Container">
  <div class="macbook-pro-mockup-content">
    <img src="/assets/images/post-mtlong-site-evo/mysite-blog.jpg" alt="Snapshot of the mtlong.me blog page.">
  </div>
