A small project of mine summer of 2015 was building a new computer desk. I designed it using AutoCAD. This post contains images of the model I made as well as the "final" product. I put final in quotations because I continue to tweak things as I go pretty much like everything else.

## Model

### Basic Frame
The basic first version of the model.

### Added Color Scheme
The color scheme consists of a black "frame" and a lightly stained desk top. The lower shelf is also stained. A piece of glass is to be placed on top as well.
