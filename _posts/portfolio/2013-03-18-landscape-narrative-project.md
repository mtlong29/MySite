The course project involved telling a story, fictional or not, about a topic of controversy. I chose genetic cloning.

Upon researching genetic cloning concerns I came across common terms such as abnormalities, disease, birth defects, experiments, and death. These terms made me think of zombies. With this in mind I decided to attempt to link genetic cloning and the zombie apocalypse. Obviously, this is therefore a fictional story.

## Narrative
The image directly below is the one I chose to use to tell my story.

### Scene One
This first scene I wanted to simply show scientists at work.

### Scene Two
In the second scene I wanted to show when things start to go south. The scientists had to shoot whatever was in the cage and they are arguing over it.
