The basics of each post can be done using markdown. I am obviously not limited to markdown for other code can be included as well. Which is great because many advanced formatting techniques do not have markdown options. There are many cheatsheets found online as to how to format a post for markdown such as <a class="fancyLink" href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet" target="_blank">here</a>.

Anything that can't be formatted using markdown is typically done using HTML. In other words raw HTML can be used in markdown, and it will work for the most part. However, markdown should not be used inside HTML. Instead, use HTML tags. Tons of information on html can be <a class="fancyLink" href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/" target="_blank">here</a>.

CSS or cascading style sheets are a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. Additional information on CSS can be found <a class="fancyLink" href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp" target="_blank">here</a>.

This is a constant work in progress as the website evolves! {% icon smile %}
