## What is Swift?

Swift was introduced by Apple in 2014. It's used for macOS, iOS, tvOS, and watchOS.

Up until 2014 development for applications on these devices was done using `Objective-C`. This was introduced a very long time ago and was built to program on a very different set of computers than we use today. It is known as legacy tooling and started to show its age.

Many people called upon Apple to fix `Objective-C`. Instead, they had been working on `Swift`.

Developers wanted a programing language that is safe, modern, and more powerful than `Objective-C`.

### Programming Languages

Types are a construct to represent different kinds of data like letters or numbers.

Syntax is the commands, special words, and punctuation you use to put together a program.

In addition to being able to program. It is also important to be able to talk like one. It's important to know the terms used by other developers.

## An Introduction to Xcode

In order to program in Swift you must have software. When we build apps, we use lots of different tools. There's an editor where we write code. An interface builder to work on the visual components of the app, and a debugger to help fix problems. Xcode is a combination of these tools and is known as an integrated development environment (or IDE).

Install this through the app store.
