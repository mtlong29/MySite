JavaScript(JS) is a lightweight interpreted programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB, and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

## Variables and Constants

Use `let` and `const` as variables. `let` is the same as what `var` was. `const` is a constant and cannot be changed. Always use `const` unless you will need to change the value then use `let`, never use `var`.

## Arrays

An array is an ordered collection of values. An array just like an object, may end with a comma. This can make it easier to add new values without risking forgetting a comma:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var fruits = [
  'Apple',
  'Banana',
];
{% endhighlight %}

Useful array methods. `pop()`: extracts the last element of the array and returns it, `push()`: appends the element to the end of the array, `shift()`: extracts the first element of the array and returns it, and `unshift()`: adds the element to the beginning of the array.
