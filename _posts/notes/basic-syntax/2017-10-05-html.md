HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language, and is used to tell your browser how to display the webpages you visit.

## Basic Structure of an HTML Document

Individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page. These are "necessary".

{% highlight html linenos %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Basic HTML Structure</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/assets/main.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

The `<link>` and `<script>` tags are not necessary, but this is where they are most often found in the basic HTML structure. The HTML syntax of HTML5 requires a DOCTYPE to be specified to ensure that the browser renders the page in standards mode.

## Common Tags

There are many HTML tags. Below are a few that many need looking up:

### Link

`<link>` tags link to external stylesheets as well as other things. You can use the `<style>` tag to write CSS directly in an HTML document.

{% highlight html linenos %}
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/assets/main.css">
{% endhighlight %}

### Script

`<script>` tags can be used to link to external JavaScript. You can also write JavaScript directly between `<script>` tags.

{% highlight html linenos %}
<script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/main.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}
