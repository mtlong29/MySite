As always a function is a sequence of instructions that perform a specific task, packaged up as a unit. Functions can help your code become DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself).

In other words whenever you write code that does the same thing more than once it is a good indication that you need a function for it.

## Function Syntax

The syntax for a Swift function:

{% highlight swift linenos %}
func area(length: Int, width: Int) {
    print(length * width)
}
area(length: 4, width: 10)
{% endhighlight %}

Obviously a function is much useful when they return something:

{% highlight swift linenos %}
func area(length: Int, width: Int) -> Int {
    return length * width
}
area(length: 4, width: 10)
{% endhighlight %}

A function that doesn't specify a `return` type it still returns a value type: `Void`. This indicates to the compiler that it doesn't return anything. Therefore, you can actually use a function that doesn't anything. There are a number of ways to do this. The simplist way is to just leave off `-> Type`.

Note like in other languages you can assign the returned value of a function to a variable or constant:

{% highlight swift linenos %}
let areaOfFirstRoom = area(length: 12, width: 17)
{% endhighlight %}

Another example:

{% highlight swift linenos %}
// Enter your code below

func temperatureInFahrenheit(temperature: Double) -> Double {
  return ((temperature * 9) / 5) + 32
}
let fahrenheitTemp = temperatureInFahrenheit(temperature: 24.0)
{% endhighlight %}

#### Quiz

Question: What keyword do we use to output a value from a function?

Answer: `return`

Question: Why will this code not compile?

{% highlight swift linenos %}
func someFunction(a: Int) -> Bool {
    return a
}
{% endhighlight %}

Answer: The value we're returning does not match the return type

Question: What keyword do we use to create a function?

Answer: `func`

Question: A function contains a random assortment of code that executes a variety of tasks.

Answer: False

Question: What is wrong with the function declaration below?

{% highlight swift linenos %}
func someFunction(Int, Int) -> Int {
    return 1
}
{% endhighlight %}

Answer: Function parameters require names

## Naming Conventions

Just as we followed a set of rules for naming constants and variables, we have a set of guidelines as to how we name our functions. There are several guidelines. One of the main rules is to follow the english language. In other words make it so that the function can be read out loud as a correct grammatical sentence.

For example, `func move(x: Int) {}` does not read as an grammatically correct prepositional sentence: "move x". To make it a prepositional sentence you would add the word "to": `func move(toX: Int) {}`. This now reads as "move to x".

Note that a preposition is a word that establishes a relationship between a noun and the rest of the sentence. For example, in "Erica climbed up the mountain", "up" is the preposition. In the sentence "Grab the folder with the stickers on it", "with" is the preposition.

Note that if there are more than one arguments then you move the preposition to the function name.

More examples:

{% highlight swift linenos %}
func remove(havingValue: String) {}
func areaWith(length: Int, width: Int) {}
{% endhighlight %}

## Argument Labels

An argument label is like a second name for an argument. Basically, you can have a local name for an argument that can be used inside a function. The external name is used outside the function such as when the function is called.

{% highlight swift linenos %}
func remove(havingValue value: String) {
    print(value)
}
remove(havingValue: "Hi!")
{% endhighlight %}

In the above, `havingValue` is used outside the function `remove` while `value` is used inside. 

This is not necessary, but it occurs quite often. Many developers use this naming convention in order to have even more control on improving the readibility of your functions.

Another example:

{% highlight swift linenos %}
// Enter your code below
func getRemainder(value a: Int, divisor b: Int) -> Int {
  return a%b
}
let result = getRemainder(value: 10, divisor: 3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Default Values

Function parameters can take on default values. The syntax for these are very simple. You just set the parameter equal to the default value you want. You can now call the function either without that parameter in which case it will default to the value given inside the function or you can call it and set a new value.

{% highlight swift linenos %}
func area(length: Int, width: Int) -> Int {
    return length * width
}

func carpetCostHaving(length l: Int, width w: Int, carpetColor color: String = "tan") -> Int {
    let areaOfRoom = area(length: l, width: w)
    var price = 0
    switch color {
        case "gray": price = areaOfRoom * 1
        case "tan": price = areaOfRoom  * 2
        case "blue": price = areaOfRoom  * 4
        default: price = 0
    }
    return price
}

carpetCostHaving(length: 6, width: 8)
carpetCostHaving(length: 6, width: 6, carpetColor: "blue")

{% endhighlight %}

## Returning Complex Values

We often would like to return more than one value from a function call and in Swift we can achieve this using a construct known as a `tuple`.

A `tuple` is simply a set of values wrapped in parentheses. They can be use in more ways than just functions.

{% highlight swift linenos %}
func area(length: Int, width: Int) -> Int {
    return length * width
}

func carpetCostHaving(length l: Int, width w: Int, carpetColor color: String = "tan") -> (Int, String) {
    let areaOfRoom = area(length: l, width: w)
    var price = 0
    switch color {
        case "gray": price = areaOfRoom * 1
        case "tan": price = areaOfRoom  * 2
        case "blue": price = areaOfRoom  * 4
        default: price = 0
    }
    return (price, color)
}

let roomOne = carpetCostHaving(length: 6, width: 8)
let roomTwo = carpetCostHaving(length: 6, width: 6, carpetColor: "blue")

roomOne.0
roomOne.1
{% endhighlight %}

With `tuples` you can also select a returned value using something similar to indexes. This is what the `roomOne.0` is referring to. `roomOne.0` is `96`.

This obviously doesn't flow well with readibility. We can give the returned values a name:

{% highlight swift linenos %}
func area(length: Int, width: Int) -> Int {
    return length * width
}

func carpetCostHaving(length l: Int, width w: Int, carpetColor color: String = "tan") -> (price: Int, carpetColor: String) {
    let areaOfRoom = area(length: l, width: w)
    var price = 0
    switch color {
        case "gray": price = areaOfRoom * 1
        case "tan": price = areaOfRoom  * 2
        case "blue": price = areaOfRoom  * 4
        default: price = 0
    }
    return (price, color)
}

let roomOne = carpetCostHaving(length: 6, width: 8)
let roomTwo = carpetCostHaving(length: 6, width: 6, carpetColor: "blue")

roomOne.price
roomOne.carpetColor
{% endhighlight %}

Now the function is much more readable. It's worth noting you can still use the `.0` and `.1`.

## Function Scope

Code added inside a function is limited to the body of the function and doesn't exist outside of it. This concept is called scope.

A variable created within a function only exists inside. These are called local variables. Variables created outside are called global variables.

It is best to avoid global variables.

## Functions Without Argument Labels

It is possible to tell Swift a function does not need to have an argument label. Built in functions like `append()` dont have labels. This can be done using an underscore, `_`.

{% highlight swift linenos %}
func area(length: Int, width: Int) -> Int {
    return length * width
}

func carpetCostHaving(_ l: Int, _ w: Int, _ color: String = "tan") -> (price: Int, carpetColor: String) {
    let areaOfRoom = area(length: l, width: w)
    var price = 0
    switch color {
        case "gray": price = areaOfRoom * 1
        case "tan": price = areaOfRoom  * 2
        case "blue": price = areaOfRoom  * 4
        default: price = 0
    }
    return (price, color)
}

let roomOne = carpetCostHaving(6, 8)
let roomTwo = carpetCostHaving(6, 8, "blue")

roomOne.price
roomOne.carpetColor
{% endhighlight %}

This is how functions like `append()` don't have labels.

Another basic function example:

{% highlight swift linenos %}
// Enter your code below
func coordinates(for location: String) -> (Double, Double) {
  switch location {
    case "Eiffel Tower": return (48.8582, 2.2945)
    case "Great Pyramid": return (29.9792, 31.1344)
    case "Sydney Opera House": return (33.8587, 151.2140)
    default: return (0, 0)
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
