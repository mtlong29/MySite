## History of HTML
Hyper Text basically means any kind of text that can be displayed on a webpage. It was originally designed to share research papers, but its usage has changed dramatically over the last few decades. This is why the word "document" still persists today.

The Internet is the hardware network that allows us to transmit data. The web is a collection of linked hypertext documents.

## Wireframing
There are many tools that can be used for wireframing such as the following:

<ul>
  <li>Pen and paper</li>
  <li>Whiteboard</li>
  <li>Photoshop</li>
  <li><a href="https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/" target="_blank">Balsamiq Mockups</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.sketchapp.com/" target="_blank">Sketch</a></li>
</ul>

## HTML5
All HTML5 really means is there are some new HTML elements that weren't available previously, along with a few new pieces of browser technology.

## < !DOCTYPE html >
This tag basically tells the browser that this is an HTML document and should ALWAYS be the first thing at the top of your website source.

## < meta charset="utf-8" >
Universal character set transformation format, eight bit. This simply describes how the page is formatted and is necessary in the < head > of every webpage.

## HTML Entities
HTML entities are ampersand codes such as &copy; or & copy; without the space. More can be found <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Basic HTML Structure
{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Matthew Long | Dog Lover</title>
  </head>
  
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Matthew Long</h1>
      <h2>Dog Lover</h2>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p>Gallery will go here.</p>
    </section>
    <footer>
      <p>&copy; 2017 Matthew Long.</p>
    </footer>
  </body>
  
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

## href
Short for hyperlink reference.

## < nav >
The navigation element is a semantic element that wraps any type of site navigation.

{% highlight html %}
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="index.html">Portfolio</a></li>
    <li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>
    <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
{% endhighlight %}

## Relative Paths vs Absolute Paths
Paths such as the one in the image tag below is known as a relative paths. This path is relative to the file.

{% highlight html %}
  <img src="img/numbers-01.jpg" alt="">
{% endhighlight%}

Paths such as the one in the image tag below is known as a absolute paths. 

{% highlight html %}
  <img src="img/numbers-01.jpg" alt="">
{% endhighlight%}

The alt tag is necessary so that if the image isn't there something appears in its place. Some examples of times you wouldn't want the image to show is for search engine spiders and visually impaired people. The alt tag can be left blank like above if there is a caption below the image.

## rel="styleseet"
Rel means relationship and it describes the relationship the current document and the linked document have.

## Normalize.css
Every browser has its own unique styling. Normalize.css is a special CSS file that will reset the default browser styles. In other words, every browser applies their own default styling so that headlines are larger than paragraphs, bulleted lists have bullets, and so on. There are some inconsistenies between these default styles from one browser to another.

## Selector Specificity
If our stylesheet isnt more specific than the browser the browsers default styling will be used.

## clear: both;
The clear property specifies on which sides of an element floating elements are not allowed to float.

## Media Queries

### Breakpoints
Each media query added is referred to as a break point. In other words, layouts can only be stretched so far before it doesn't look good anymore. Sometimes these break points may even be based on the screen resolution of popular devices.

## Pseudo Class Selector
A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). For example, :hover can be used to apply a style when the user hovers over a button.

For more on pseudo-classes go <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes" target="_blank">here</a>


## Viewport
{% highlight html %}
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
{% endhighlight %}

The above meta tag is necessary for telling a mobile phone how to view your webpage.

## Website Testing
Check that site still looks good in grayscale (strong contrast) to decide whether site will look good to the visually impaired.

Flipping a site upsidedown. Doing this will check that one side of your site isn't heavier than the other.

Blurring a website. This allows you to examin design details such as arrangement. This will also check the legibility of the site.

### Check whether HTML and CSS are Valid
Copy and paste your HTML source into sites such as <a href="http://validator.w3.org" target="_blank">validator.w3.org</a> to test sites HTML.

Copy and paste your CSS source into sites such as <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org" target="_blank">jigsaw.w3.org</a> to test sites CSS.

## Finding a Domain
<ul>
  <li>Protocol - A system of rules for the exchange of digital information. On the web, the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) allows for the exchange of websites.</li>
  <li>Subdomain - A smaller domain that is part of a larger domain. For example, "www" is a common subdomain.</li>
  <li>Domain - A unique identifying string that defines a realm of authority or control on the web.</li>
  <li>TLD - TLD stands for Top Level Domain and it is the highest level domain in the Domaain Name System (DNS). This is the part of the domain such as .com, .net, and .org, that comes at the end.</li>
</ul>

## Pick a Web Host
Web hosting gives us space on the web to upload our site so that it can be served to site visitors.

## Things I've learned
<ol>
  <li>The reason the work document is still used for webpages.</li>
  <li>I do not use the section tags enough.</li>
  <li>Never leave off charset=utf-8" from your website.</li>
  <li>I don't approach website design with a mobile first attitude enough. After all.. it's easier to take a simple layout (mobile) and make it more complex (desktop) rather than tryign to reduce a complex layout to its simplest form.</li>
</ol>
