Notes that review new features available in ES2015, the 6th edition of ECMAScript. ES2015 is the largest upgrade to JavaScript since its creation. The language has new data types, improved utility functions, and features to better define the scope of your code blocks.

The first version of JavaScript was developed by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 10 days. By 1997 JavaScript is found in every browser. ECMAScript and JavaScript are the same thing. They are enterchangeable. JavaScript is the only language native in web browsers. In the early data Microsoft & Netscape, were at the center of "the browser wars".

## Const and Let

For most of JavaScript's life, there's been only one way to create, or "declare", a variable: the `var` keyword. In a recent version of JavaScript there are two new ways: `const` and `let`.

```javascript
var message = 'Hello';
let something = 'Yo';
const woohoo = 'Hi';
```

Most JavaScript developers learned the `var` method, and a lot still use the `var` keyword.

Some of the behaviors from using `var` can be problematic or unexpected. That is why developers of the JavaScript programming language decided to introduce new ways fro creating variables. The sixth version of JavaScript, called ES2015, or ECMAScript 2015, introduced two new keywords, `const` and `let`.

As you can see about `const` and `let` work in similarily to `var`.

>Use `let` when you need to reassign a variable, or scope a variable at the block level. Use `const` when you don't want a variable's value to change throughout your project.

## Creating Unchanging Variables With Const

Using the keyword `const` to create variables have a number of benefits including the ability to prevent the value from being reassigned.

`const` is the first method you should consider when creating a variable. `const` is short for constant, meaning that the value of the variable shouldn't change it should remain constant.

Some examples of when to use `const`:

- Tax rates
- Dimensions of user interface components
- Product prices

### Using Constants with Arrays and Objects

You cannot reassign a constant variable in the case of a number or a string. The same goes for any value of a constant variable. You cannot reassign strings, numbers, booleans. Objects and arrays have methods and properties that modify the objects or array. 

```javascript
const days = ["Monday"];
days.push("Tuesday");
const
// ["Monday", "Tuesday"]
const days = ["Wednesday", "Thursday"];
// Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
const person = {
  firstName: "Matthew", 
  lastName: "Long"
}
person = {
  firstName: "Billy", 
  lastName: "Boi"
}
// Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
person.firstName = "Billy";
// person = {firstName: "Billy", lastName: "Long"}
```

>You can modify them but you cant reassign them.

## Defining a Variable with let

Using constants is a best practice when assigning variables, but what happens when you do actually want to reassign a value. That's where `let` comes in.

In this respect it works just like `var`.

```javascript
let score = 1;
score++
// 2
```

### Using let with for Loops

If you use the `var` declaration in a for loop then `i`, for example, is defined globally. 

The following example will show the difference between using `let` and `var` in a for loop.

```html
<button>Button 0</button>
<button>Button 1</button>
<button>Button 2</button>
<button>Button 3</button>
<button>Button 4</button>
<button>Button 5</button>
<button>Button 6</button>
<button>Button 7</button>
<button>Button 8</button>
<button>Button 9</button>
<button>Button 10</button>
```

So the following alert would display 10 every time a button is pressed.

```javascript
const buttons = document.getElementsByTagName('button');
for (var i = 0; i < buttons.length, i++) {
  const button = buttons[i];
  button.addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert('Button ' + i + ' Pressed')
  });
}
```

This time the `let` variable declaration of `i` is localized to each cycle of the for loop. Which means the correct `i` value will show depending on which button is clicked.

```javascript
const buttons = document.getElementsByTagName('button');
for (let i = 0; i < buttons.length, i++) {
  const button = buttons[i];
  button.addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert('Button ' + i + ' Pressed')
  });
}
```

The problem with `var` is related to scope. The variable `i` lives in what's called the global score.

Using `let` gives each button its own local copy of `i`. This means that the `let` variable declaration of `i` is localized to each cycle of the for loop. In other words the `i` variable is distinct for each cycle through the loop.

## Template Literals

There are many ways to concatenate strings, replace content in strings, join strings, etc. However, there is a new way to create a string using ES2015.

**Template literals can be written just like other strings except instead of single quotes or double quotes use back tick character.** This character is in the upper left hand corner of a QWERTY keyboard. 

Template literals get their name from their ability to evaluate expressions. **Think of a form letter template with blanks to hold names or numbers that can be filled in later**: "Dear __, Thank you for your business on __. Sincerely, Management". Similarly, values can be filled or interpolated, into template literals, to be evaluated when the program runs. The following example shows how this works.

```javascript
const student = { name: 'James', followerCount: 34 };
let html = `
  <h1>${student.name}</h1>
  <p>followers: ${student.followerCount}</p>`;
console.log(html);
// <h1>James</h1>
// <p>followers: 34</p>
```

## String Search Methods

With the new `startsWith`, `endsWith`, and `includes` methods we can use plain english when writing JavaScript when searching strings.

#### startsWith

```javascript
let strToSearch = 'a-really-long-hyphenated-string';
console.log(/^a-really/.test(strToSearch)); // test string w/ regular expression
console.log(strToSearch.indexOf('a-really') === 0); // indexOf
console.log(strToSearch.startsWith('a-really')); // startsWith
// true
// true
// true
```

#### endsWith

```javascript
let strToSearch = 'a-really-long-hyphenated-string';
console.log(/hyphenated-string$/.test(strToSearch)); // test string w/ regular expression
console.log(strToSearch.indexOf('hyphenated-string') === strToSearch.length - 'hyphenated-string'.length); // indexOf
console.log(strToSearch.endsWith('hyphenated-string')); // endsWith
// true
// true 
// true
```

#### includes 

```javascript
let strToSearch = 'a-really-long-hyphenated-string';
console.log(/long/.test(strToSearch)); // test string w/ regular expression
console.log(strToSearch.indexOf('long') > -1); // indexOf
console.log(strToSearch.includes('long')); // includes
// true
// true
// true
```

#### Second Parameter

All of the new methods take a second parameter. For the `startsWith` and `endWith` the second parameter is an integer for where the method begins. The second parameter for the `includes` maximum length of the searchable string. Therefore, if you add `20` as a second parameter it will only look at the first 20 characters.

## Arrow Functions

Arrow functions are often referred to as lambda functions in other programming languages.

Arrow functions are less verbose than function declarations. But they can get even more concise.

If your arrow function only takes a single argument like in the case of the following example. You don't need parentheses.

```javascript
var Person = function (data) {
  for (var key in data) {
    this[key] = data[key];  
  }
  this.getKeys = () => {
    return Object.keys(this);
  }
}

var Alena = new Person({ name: 'Alena', role: 'Teacher' });
console.log('Alena\'s Keys:', Alena.getKeys()); // 'this' refers to 'Alena'

var getKeys = Alena.getKeys;
console.log(getKeys()); // 'this' refers to the node process
```

The arrow, or lambda function, binds the function to the instance of the person no matter where it was called. In other words, an arrow function is bound to its parent scope.

You can reduce the arrow syntax further by removing the curly braces when you only have a single line of code in your function. This can really clean up your code to be more concise. See the square example from before revisited below.

```javascript
const square = x => x*x;
```

Don't forget if there are more than one argument for a function you have to include the parentheses. Also, if there are no arguments you must have the empty parantheses, `()`.

#### Example Two:

```javascript
const square = (x) => x * x;
const cube = (x) => square(x) * x;
cube(2);
// 8
```

## Promises

>A `promise` is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. Essentially, a `promise` is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function.

Learn more on [the MDN Page for "Using Promises"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises)!

Instead of an old-style function that expects two callbacks, and calls one of them on eventual completion or failure:

```javascript
function successCallback(result) {
  console.log("It succeeded with " + result);
}

function failureCallback(error) {
  console.log("It failed with " + error);
}

doSomething(successCallback, failureCallback);
```

...modern functions return a promise you can attach your callbacks to instead:

```javascript
let promise = doSomething(); 
promise.then(successCallback, failureCallback);
```

... or simply:

```javascript
doSomething().then(successCallback, failureCallback);
```

This is called an **asynchronous function call**. This convention has several advantages.

#### Guarantees

- Callbacks will never be called before the completion of the current run of the JavaScript event loop.
- Callbacks added with `.then` even *after* the success or failure of the asynchronous operation, will be created, as above.
- Multiple callbacks may be added by calling `.then` several times, to be executed independently in insertion order.

>The most immediate benefit of `promises` is chaining.

#### Chaining

A common need is to execute two or more asynchronous operations back to back, where each subsequent operation starts when the previous operation succeeds, with the result from the previous step. This is accomplished with a *promise chain*.

The `then` function returns a new promise, different from the original:

```javascript
let promise = doSomething();
let promise2 = promise.then(successCallback, failureCallback);
```

...or

```javascript
let promise2 = doSomething().then(successCallback, failureCallback);
```

## Default Parameters

FINALLY JavaScript is able set default values for function parameters like every other programming language.

```javascript
function greet(name, timeOfDay) {
  name = name || 'Guil';
  timeOfDay = timeOfDay || 'Day';
  console.log(`Good ${timeOfDay}, ${name}!`);
}
greet();
// Good Day, Guil!
```

```javascript
function greet(name = 'Guil', timeOfDay = 'Day') {
  console.log(`Good ${timeOfDay}, ${name}!`);
}

greet();
// Good Day, Guil!
```

You can enter `undefined` for parameter value if you want to use the default value for one, but a passed parameter for another, for example.

```javascript
function greet(name = 'Guil', timeOfDay = 'Day') {
  console.log(`Good ${timeOfDay}, ${name}!`);
}

greet(undefined, 'Afternoon');
// Good Afternoon, Guil!
```

Default values can be strings, booleans, objects, arrays, or functions.

Learn more on the [MDN Page for Default parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters).

## Rest Parameters and Spread Operator

Rest parameters let you specify an unknown number of parameters. The spread operator lets you specify an unknown number of array properties.

Both rest parameters and spread operators look similar because they share the same `...` syntax. A rest parameter collects the arguments passed to a function, while a spread operator expands an array or any type of expression.

### Rest Parameters

```javascript
function myFunction(name, ...params) {
  console.log(name, params);
}

myFunction('andrew', 1, 2, 3, 4, 'Ken');
// andrew [1,2,3,4, 'Ken']
```

```javascript
function myFunction(...params) {
  console.log(params);
}

myFunction('andrew', 1, 2, 3, 4, 'Ken');
// [1,2,3,4, 'Ken']
```

### Spread Operator

```javascript
const originalFlavors = ['Chocolate', 'Vanilla'];
const newFlavors = ['Strawberry', 'Mint Chocolate Chip'];
const inventory = ['Rocky Road', ...originalFlavors, 'Neopolitan', ...newFlavors];

console.log(inventory);
// ['Rocky Road', 'Chocolate', 'Vanilla', 'Neopolitan', 'Strawberry', 'Mint Chocolate Chip']
```

```javascript
function myFunction (name, iceCreamFlavor) {
  console.log(`${name} really likes ${iceCreamFlavor} ice cream.`)
}

let args = ['Gabe', 'Vanilla'];

myFunction(...args);
// Gabe really likes Vanilla ice cream.
```

## Destructuring 

Destructuring lets you break apart an array or object into variables.

#### Destructuring Objects 

```javascript
let toybox = { item1: 'car', item2: 'ball', item3: 'frisbee' };

let {item1, item2} = toybox;

console.log(item1);
// car
```

#### Destructuring Array 

```javascript
let widgets = ['widget1', 'widget2', 'widget3', 'widget4', 'widget5'];

let  [a, b, c, ...d] = widgets;

console.log(a);
// widget1
```

```javascript
let widgets = ['widget1', 'widget2', 'widget3', 'widget4', 'widget5'];

let  [a, b, c, ...d] = widgets;

console.log(d);
// ['widget4', 'widget5']
```

#### Destructuring Default Function 

```javascript
function getData({ url, method = 'post' } = {}, callback) {
  callback(url, method);
}

getData({ url: 'myposturl.com' }, function (url, method) {
  console.log(url, method);
});

getData({ url: 'myputurl.com', method: 'put' }, function (url, method) {
 console.log(url, method);
});
// myposturl.com post
// myputurl.com put
```

#### Destructuring Nested Objects 

```javascript
let parentObject = {
  title: 'Super Important',
  childObject: {
    title: 'Equally Important'
  }
}

let { title, childObject: { title: childTitle } } = parentObject

console.log(childTitle);
// Equally Important
```
