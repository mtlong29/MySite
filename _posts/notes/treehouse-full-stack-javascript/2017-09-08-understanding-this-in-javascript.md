**JavaScript has a special keyword to give access to a specific context.** The `this` keyword can be used to access values, methods, and other objects on a context specific basis. Meaning, this changes based on where it is used. That is what makes `this` so powerful and it's also what makes it such a huge headache to understand.

## Debugging Strategies

The `this` keyword can be used as a debugging strategy as well. Being able to play with `this` in different contexts can be super helpful. Plus, these debugging strategies will make your debugging workflow go much faster.

**The JavaScript interpreter assigns a value to `this` based on where it appears.** There are *four* main ways that `this` takes a value.

- In normal function calls.
- Within methods on objects.
- Within an object that has been constructed.
- A function invoked with .call, .apply, or bind.

## this In Normal Function Calls

In the below example, a function named `helloWorld` is called. The script logged two things, the "Hello world" string, and `this`, which is the *window object* in the context of a normal function.

```javascript
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello world!");
  console.log(this);
};
helloWorld();
```

When you call a function in this way, this is going to be the global context. In a browsers, it's the window object. But if we were in a Node app things would be quite a bit different.

## this Within Methods on Objects

The *second* way that you can use `this` is within a method on an object. It's also one of the most powerful ways that `this` can be used.

#### Example One

```javascript
var Portland = {
  bridges: 12,
  airport: 1,
  soccerTeams: 1,
  logNumberOfBridges: function() {
    console.log("There are " + this.bridges + " bridges in Portland!")
  }
}
Portland.logNumberOfBridges();
// There are 12 bridges in Portland!
```

#### Example Two

```javascript
var Portland = {
  bridges: 12,
  airport: 1,
  soccerTeams: 1,
  logNumberOfBridges: function() {
    console.log("There are " + this.bridges + " bridges in Portland!")
  },
  logTeams: function() {
    console.log(this.soccerTeams);
  }
}
Portland.logTeams();
// 1
```

#### Example Three

```javascript
var Portland = {
  bridges: 12,
  airport: 1,
  soccerTeams: 1,
  logNumberOfBridges: function() {
    console.log("There are " + this.bridges + " bridges in Portland!")
  }
}
function logTeams () {
  console.log(this.soccerTeams);
}
Portland.foo = logTeams;
Portland.foo();
logTeams();
// 1
// undefined
```

In the last example you get `undefined` because `logTeams()` does not contain `soccerTeams`. However, `portland.foo()` does contain `soccerTeams`. You can see/debug this issue by logging `this` to the console instead of `this.soccerTeams`.


## this Within an object that has been constructed

One of the most powerful ways to use `this` is on a constructor function. The following constructor function takes two parameters a `name` and a `state` parameter.

```javascript
var City = function(name, state) {
  this.name = name || 'Portland';
  this.state = state || 'Oregon';
  this.printMyCityAndState = function() {
    console.log("My city is " + this.name + ", and my state is " + this.state);
  };
};
portland = new City();
seattle = new City('Seattle', 'Washington');
salem = new City('Salem');
vancouver = new City('Vancouver', 'Washington');
portland.printMyCityAndState();
seattle.printMyCityAndState();
salem.printMyCityAndState();
vancouver.printMyCityAndState();
```

See that `this.name = name || 'Portland';` line means that if the a `name` parameter is passed then it will use that, but if not then it will default to `Portland`.

The `new` keyword is also a special keyword in JavaScript, and all it says is that, I'm gonna create a new instance using `this` constructor function.

My city is, the value of `this.name`. And my state is, the value plus the value of `this.state`.

One of the reasons that the constructor function is so valuable is because you can basically repeat this hundreds of times and the `this` keyword will always respond to the object that's been created, allowing you to create applications with highlight replicable code.
