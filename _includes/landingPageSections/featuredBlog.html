  <p>This attempt at “blogging” is actually a method of keeping notes mainly for myself. However, others are more than welcome to see these notes. Below are a few of not necessarily most recent, but most relevant. Click <a href="{{site.url}}/blog" class="fancyLink">here</a> to see all blog posts.</p>
  
  <div class="tiles">
      
    {% assign features = site.categories[page.feature-blog.category] | where:"featured", true %}
    
      {% for post in features limit:3 %}
				
				{% include /globalSections/tileHorizontal.html %}
