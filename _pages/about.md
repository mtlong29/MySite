Hello, my name is Matthew Long.

I don't find the time to update this page near as often as I would like. My life/interests/hobbies change faster than this page does. Therefore, it is best to keep this very brief. I am a lifelong learner with interests in a wide range of things such as sports, software engineering, web development, gaming, and dogs.
